# Windows-File-Conversion-Utility

At some point I am going to write more detail here, but for now just know that this app adds a button to your context menu (right click on files) that allows you to quickly convert one file format into another.

To-Do:
     1. Add All Picture File formats (Currently Only .jpg Woks)
     2. Make cmd window not appear when converting images
     3. Add .ico support for images
     4. Add Audio File Support.
